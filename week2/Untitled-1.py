Tic-Tac-Toe: my solution to this activity.
I made it in Python 3. Using whatever tutorial and resources I could find.
So please forgive me if it looks like a Frankenstein. GitHub copilot helped as well.
So far, I have been able to make it work. I have tried to make it as easy as possible.
You just need to enter a row and a column number to start the game."""
